## Technology and Library Usage for Shop Page

This section highlights specific technologies and libraries relevant to the shop page functionality, as identified from the project requirements.

- **Multer**: A Node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for uploading files. In the context of the shop page, Multer will be essential for enabling administrators to upload book cover images and other related media when adding or updating book entries. It simplifies the process of handling file uploads by parsing the incoming request and making the file available in the `req.file` or `req.files` object.

- **Redis**: An open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. For the shop page, Redis will be crucial for implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data, such as the book list, popular filter combinations, and search results. This significantly improves response times and reduces the load on the primary MongoDB database.

- **MongoDB Text Indexes**: MongoDB's text indexes support full-text search queries on string content. For the shop page, this feature will be leveraged to enable efficient and powerful search capabilities across book titles, authors, descriptions, and tags, allowing users to quickly find relevant books based on keywords.

- **Mongoose Validations**: Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, provides built-in schema validation. This will be used to enforce data integrity for book-related data, ensuring that fields like price are positive, stock is an integer, and other data types conform to defined rules before being saved to the database.

- **Joi/Ajv (Schema Validation)**: These libraries provide robust schema validation for incoming request payloads. For the shop page, they will be used on the backend to validate user input for search queries, filter parameters, and admin-specific book management operations, ensuring that only well-formed and valid data is processed by the API.

- **Angular Material/Bootstrap**: Frontend UI frameworks that provide pre-built, responsive components. These will be used to build the shop page's user interface, ensuring a modern, consistent, and responsive design across various devices. They simplify the development of elements like grids, cards, search bars, and filter sidebars.

- **Angular HttpClient**: Angular's built-in module for making HTTP requests. This will be the primary tool for the frontend to interact with the backend APIs, fetching book data, submitting search queries, and handling other shop page related communications.

- **Socket.io**: A JavaScript library for real-time web applications. While not directly for the shop page's core browsing, it's mentioned in the overall project for real-time notifications (e.g., notifying admins of new orders). It could potentially be used for real-time updates on stock levels or flash sales on the shop page, though this is an advanced consideration.

## Summary of Backend and Frontend Responsibilities for Shop Page

### Backend Responsibilities

The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, is primarily responsible for data management, business logic, and API exposure for the shop page. Its key responsibilities include:

### Day 1.5 (or remaining time): Integration, Reviews, Recommendations & Refinements

**Student 1 (Backend - Reviews & Recommendations)**
- **Focus**: Implement `GET /api/books/:id/reviews` and `POST /api/books/:id/reviews`. Also, work on `GET /api/books/:id/recommendations` and `GET /api/recommendations/personalized` (initial AI integration).
- **Deliverables**: Functional review submission/retrieval APIs, initial recommendation APIs.

**Student 2 (Backend - Cart & Wishlist Integration)**
- **Focus**: Implement `POST /api/cart/add`, `GET /api/cart`, `PUT /api/cart/update`, and the wishlist APIs (`POST /api/wishlist/add`, `GET /api/wishlist`, `DELETE /api/wishlist/:bookId`).
- **Deliverables**: Functional cart and wishlist APIs.

**Student 3 (Frontend - Reviews & Recommendations Integration)**
- **Focus**: Integrate review display and submission into the book details page. Integrate personalized and related book recommendations into the shop page and book details page.
- **Deliverables**: Reviews visible and submittable, recommendations displayed.

**Student 4 (Frontend - Cart & Wishlist Integration)**
- **Focus**: Integrate 


cart and wishlist functionalities into the `BookCardComponent` and `BookQuickViewComponent`. Implement the logic for adding items to cart/wishlist and updating their status.
- **Deliverables**: Add to Cart/Wishlist buttons functional, communicating with backend.

**Student 5 (Frontend - UI/UX Refinements & Accessibility)**
- **Focus**: Conduct a thorough UI/UX review of the entire shop page. Implement accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support). Ensure responsive design is robust across various devices. Address any visual inconsistencies or bugs.
- **Deliverables**: Polished and accessible shop page UI, cross-device compatibility.

### General Considerations for All Students:
- **Communication**: Daily stand-ups and constant communication are crucial for resolving dependencies and integrating work.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for all code changes, with frequent commits and clear branch management.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for individual components/APIs and integration tests for the overall flow.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure both frontend and backend handle errors gracefully and provide informative messages.
- **Code Review**: Peer code reviews can help maintain code quality and catch issues early.

This distribution aims to maximize parallel development while ensuring that core functionalities are covered within the given timeframe. The leads (Student 1 and Student 3) will also be responsible for overall integration and ensuring their respective stacks are cohesive.
